# Creating and Maintaining a Platform Stack

A Platform Stack has to be provided as a docker image. It contains the generator template, the config file as well as the static artefacts necessary for running the docker-compose.yml generated by the stack.

A generator is based on the [Docker Compose Templer](https://github.com/Aisbergg/python-docker-compose-templer) project, a small utility that adds more dynamism to Docker Compose files by utilizing the Jinja2 template engine. We added some wrapper logic around it to make it easier to use. 

The implementation of a generator supporting a platform version and platform type is contained in a docker image itself, which is completly independent of the MDP tool itself. Currently there is only one pla

## How to build 
The service generator is available as a docker image from where it can be run. 

It can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/trivadis/modern-data-platform-stack-generator) under `trivadis/modern-data-platform-stack-generator`.

If you want to build the docker image locally, perform (this is not necessary if you follow the installation instructions below).

```
docker build -t trivadis/platys-modern-data-platform:1.3.0 .
```
